# wordWrap
WordWrap interview problem

Goal is to reproduce the wordWrap function outlined in the php manual

http://php.net/manual/en/function.wordwrap.php

Since this is an interative process, this repository will serve to chronicle the
changes to the solution as I work through it.

This readme will update with times taken to complete certain milestones.

Commit messages will outline my thought processes on each implementation and iteration.

| Step | Time to complete |
|------|------------------|
|initial setup | 2:05 |
| readme outline | 4:06 |
